## Phase 0 — Repository audit & technical planning

**Branch:** `claude/repo-audit-architecture-MiZDX`
**Status:** Complete (documentation only — no production code changed).

### What was done

- Inspected the entire repository: monorepo config, mobile app, dashboard, Cloud Functions, design tokens, Firestore rules and indexes, storage rules, scripts, and existing docs.
- Inventoried every screen (13 mobile), every admin page (11 + login + redirect), every Cloud Function (7), every Firestore collection (11 declared, 4+ implied), every composite index (4), and every TODO marker (21).
- Mapped 36 product design modules to their current implementation state.
- Drafted a 20-phase roadmap with acceptance criteria, scope, risks, and rollback per phase.
- Wrote 50+ issue-ready GitHub tasks, each labelled by phase + surface + priority.
- Compiled a 22-row risk register covering security, abuse, cost, privacy, and UX risks.
- Produced a consolidated technical architecture covering monorepo, mobile, dashboard, Firebase, Firestore, security rules, Functions, gateway, points, escalation, receipts, views, RBAC, audit, RTL, dark mode, testing, deployment.

### Checks run

- Repository structure inspected on the current commit of `claude/repo-audit-architecture-MiZDX`.
- No code modifications; no installs, builds, or tests were executed in Phase 0 (deferred to Phase 1 CI baseline).

### Known issues uncovered (full list in the Risk Register)

- `functions/src/points/buy.ts` credits points without payment verification — must close before any production traffic.
- Dashboard has no role-aware route guard.
- `statuses` audience is enforced client-side only.
- Several Firestore collections needed by later phases have no rules yet.
- No CI in `.github/workflows/`.
- No audit logging anywhere.
- Native phone OTP path unimplemented.
- Multiple mobile and dashboard screens are placeholders.

### Recommended Phase 1 scope

**Phase 1 — Design system, layout shells, and routing cleanup.**

1. Promote `@offlinesms/design-tokens` to expose semantic role tokens (`text.*`, `surface.*`, `border.*`, `state.*`, `action.*`) on top of the current palette, with a compatibility shim for existing imports.
2. Add a server-side guard at `apps/dashboard/app/admin/layout.tsx` that verifies a session cookie and the `admin: true` custom claim. Add the supporting `/api/session` route.
3. Add shared edge-state primitives (`LoadingState`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`, `PermissionState`, `SuccessState`) in both apps; convert existing `/admin/*` pages and `ChatsList` / `Points` to use them.
4. Add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running install → typecheck → lint → build for all workspaces on every PR.

Phase 1 must not touch chat data flow, Firestore rules of the messaging system, or Functions business logic.
